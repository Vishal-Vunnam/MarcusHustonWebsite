                    About Me:<br>
                    I’m Marcus Huston, an Information Science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a minor in Communications. I’m passionate about data, technology, and community to uncover insights, solve complex problems, and make meaningful impacts in the community. With professional experience spanning library services, team leadership, and event coordination, I’ve honed my ability to organize, analyze, and communicate effectively. CU Boulder has deepened my technical skills in Python, data visualization tools like Tableau, and other tools such as SQL and R. From developing code to process and analyze large datasets to crafting engaging presentations of findings, I enjoy transforming data into actionable insights. Outside of academics and work, I take pride in building community through my role as Coordinator for CU Boulder's Skate Forge. Planning large-scale skateboarding events and collaborating with local sponsors
